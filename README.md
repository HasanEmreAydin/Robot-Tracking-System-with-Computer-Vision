# Robot-Tracking-System-with-Computer-Vision

In this project, a 2-link planar robot was programmed to track a ball using computer vision techniques. Camera calibration was performed to estimate intrinsic and distortion parameters, followed by HSV and BGR color space processing for ball detection and tracking. Image coordinates were converted to real-world coordinates, and inverse kinematics calculations were applied to determine the robotâ€™s movements.

Dynamixel SDK was used for robot control, OpenCV for image processing, and C++ with Makefile for software development. Git/GitFlow was utilized for version control, and the code was developed to run on a Linux operating system. As a result, the robot was able to track the ball in real-time based on camera input.
